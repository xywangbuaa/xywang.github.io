Xueyan Wang, an Assistant Professor at the School of Integrated Circuits Science and Engineering, Beihang University, has been recognized as a part of the 9th China Association for Science and Technology "Young Talents Support Project."

In 2013, she earned her Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology from Shandong University, where she was honored as an "Outstanding Graduate." She was then recommended for direct Ph.D. admission to Tsinghua University's Department of Computer Science and Technology. In 2018, she received her Ph.D. in Engineering, co-trained with the University of Maryland, College Park.

In 2018, she was awarded the "Excellence Hundred Talents" postdoctoral position at Beihang University. In 2021, she joined the faculty as an Assistant Professor in the School of Integrated Circuits Science and Engineering.

Experience
-----------
Dr. Wang's research areas include hardware-software co-design for acceleration, in-memory computing architectures and chip design, and chip security. Over the past five years, she has published more than 20 papers as the first or corresponding author in prestigious conferences and journals such as IEEE TC, ACM/IEEE DAC, and IEEE TCAD.

She has led various national and corporate projects, including the National Natural Science Foundation of China's Young Scientists Fund, the CCF-Ant Research Fund for Hardware-Software Co-Design, the Beihang Frontier Interdisciplinary Fund, and key laboratory open topics. Additionally, she has been a core member of national key projects and Huawei technology collaboration projects.

Dr. Wang has contributed to three textbooks and monographs: Spintronics Science and Technology, Integrated Circuit Design Automation, and Hardware Protection through Obfuscation.

She is a senior member of the China Computer Federation (CCF), a member of ACM and IEEE, and serves as an executive committee member of the CCF's Integrated Circuit Design and Fault-Tolerant Computing Technical Committees. She has held roles in numerous international conferences and journals, including being the Publication Chair for the inaugural CCFDAC and a TPC member for IEEE DATE 2024/2023/2022, ACM/IEEE ASP-DAC 2022/2021/2020, IEEE SOCC 2024/2023/2022/2021/2020, ACM GLSVLSI 2020, among others. She has also been a subcommittee chair for ACM/IEEE ASP-DAC 2022/2020, CFTC 2019, and a reviewer for ACM TODAES, IEEE TCAD, IEEE TNANO, and DATE conferences and journals.

She has presented tutorial sessions at the IEEE SOCC 2021 international conference and delivered multiple oral presentations at international conferences such as ACM/IEEE DAC, ACM/IEEE ASP-DAC, ACM GLSVLSI, and IEEE ISCAS.

Teaching
-----------
In her teaching role, she lectures undergraduate courses such as "Computer Organization and System Architecture" and graduate courses like "Integrated Circuit Security" (Huawei Pilot Course) and "Modern Micro and Nano Electronics" (recognized as a "Beijing Higher Education Graduate Course Ideological and Political Demonstration Course" and a university-level graduate boutique course). She has been honored as a "Beijing Course Ideological and Political Teaching Master." Additionally, she has been recognized as an Outstanding Counselor and Excellent Communist Party Member at the School of Integrated Circuits.

Her mentorship has led students to win national awards, such as the second prize in the National College Student Integrated Circuit Innovation and Entrepreneurship Competition and the Excellent Paper Award at the National Microelectronics Graduate Academic Forum. She has also been recognized as an "Outstanding Mentor." She has supervised eight graduate students, six of whom have produced high-level academic papers, and one undergraduate student who published a CCF A-level top conference paper and secured a Ph.D. offer from the National University of Singapore.
